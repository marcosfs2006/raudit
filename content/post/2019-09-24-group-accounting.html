<p><strong>What do you purchase (Asset vs Business)?</strong></p>
<p>FRS 103(R) Business Combinations determines if an acquired set of activities and assets is a business;</p>

<p>Subsidiries;</p>
<ul>
<li>Previously held interest is not remeasured <strong>until</strong> it becomes a subsidiary</li>
<li>AFS to Associate (Dr: Current investment, Cr: Previous equity, Cr: Cash)</li>
<li>Associate to Subsidiary (DR: Investment, Cr: P/L, as if sell buy back, then consolidation allocation).</li>
<li>Same treatment in the case of disposal.</li>
</ul>
<p>If Co issues FG to the Bank, Co still has risks and rewards. Thus, Co has to consolidate SPV with 100% NCI.</p>

<ul>
<li>AFS reserve recycles to P/L (a part of disposal gain)</li>
<li>Revaluation reserve recycles to R/E (not disposal gain)</li>
<li>Accounting treatment should be same (recognize a full gain).</li>
